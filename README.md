Simulation of "Bayesian billiards" or the "Problem of Points".

In this repository we have 2 codes:

BayesianBilliardsSimulation.ipynb - This code make some preliminar simualtion and vizualization of the problem, first simulate the problem in 1 dimensional and them make it into 2 dimensions.

BayesianBilliardsVideo.ipynb - This code generate the images representing the PDF and then make the video.
Obs.: The first part of generating the images are computational heavy, in my machine it took about 35 min to generate all 1000 images.
